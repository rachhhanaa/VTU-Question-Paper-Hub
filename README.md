# VTU-Question-Paper-Hub
Our mini-project, titled "VTU Question Paper Hub," is a collaborative effort aimed at developing a user-friendly platform for VTU students to access semester-end question papers. The platform is designed to categorize question papers based on year, semester, and subject code, ensuring easy retrieval and convenience for students.
